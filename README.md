# spring-dependency-injection
Basic program to represent how dependency injection works in Spring

Please follow below path for better understanding.

1) Read all comments and uncomment those changes to check how tight coupling works.
2) Now go on to consider changes where how loose coupling has been implemented is shown.
3) Finally check for annotations where I have added description telling what every annotation does.

I will keep adding more details to this project as I learn new stuff.
